# Quickstart

<MotomoComponent/>

Superfluid is a protocol revolving around a new token standard called Super Token. Super Tokens have special capabilities (super powers?).
One of them allows to create second-by-second token transfers (called Money Streaming).
In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up and deploying a basic contract for creating, updating and deleting Superfluid money streams. Let's go!

## Prerequisites

- Solidity knowledge
- A development environment *(Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry)*
- A testnet wallet *(e.g., MetaMask)*
- Access to a testnet native coin *(e.g. Polygon Mumbai Testnet Matic - get faucet [here](https://faucet.matic.network/))*


## Contract Overview: FlowSender

In this guide we will describe the contract `FlowSender`:
- This contract is designed to interact with the Superfluid protocol, specifically to send [Super Tokens](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/overview.mdx) using [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx).
- This contract enables the creation, modification, and deletion of continuous money streams.
- The contract interacts with an example super token (fake DAI Super Token - fDAIx) to create a stream from itself to a receiver.
- Each time a stream is created, a new receiver is added to the list of receivers, and the Superfluid Protocol keeps track of the balances and the receivers on the blockchain.

:::tip *What is Tx?* 

If you are new to blockchain development, you may not be familiar with the term "Tx". Tx is short for transaction, which is a record of an action on the blockchain. Transactions are used to transfer value, store data, and interact with smart contracts.

- **gainDaiX**: Mints and wraps fDAI into fDAIx (Superfluid's wrapped token).
- **createStream**: Initiates a new money stream to a specified receiver.
- **updateStream**: Updates an existing money stream's flow rate.
- **deleteStream**: Terminates an existing money stream.
- **readFlowRate**: Reads the current flow rate of a stream.

## Environment Setup and Deployment

Deploy the `FlowSender` contract to a testnet like Mumbai using your preferred development environment.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="remix" label="Remix IDE" default>

### Using Remix IDE

1. **Access Remix IDE**: Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. **Create New File**: In the 'File Explorers' tab, create a new `.sol` file.
3. **Paste Contract Code**: Copy the `FlowSender` contract code into the new file.
4. **Compile the Contract**: Go to the 'Solidity Compiler' tab and click 'Compile'.
5. **Deploy the Contract**: 
    - Switch to the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab.
    - Connect to MetaMask, selecting Mumbai Testnet.
    - Click on 'Deploy' to deploy your contract.

For more information, check out the [Remix IDE documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

:::info *What is the token address?*
When deploying the contract, you will need to provide the address of the fDAIx token on the testnet you are using. For example, on Mumbai Testnet, the address of fDAIx is `0x5D8B4C2554aeB7e86F387B4d6c00Ac33499Ed01f`.

For other testnets, make sure to check out the [Superfluid console](https://console.superfluid.finance/goerli/supertokens).

## Interacting with the Contract

Once you have deployed your contract, you can run your tests on your favourite framework. You can also test your smart contract live in the browser using the Superfluid Flow Sender Playground below. Modify `yourAddress` putting the address to your deployed contract and follow the steps on the interface below.

```jsx live
function FlowSenderPlayground() {

const yourAddress="0xe8f9eEDf7f171111169C71119cd625ee629E9831";
return (
    <div>
      <FlowSenderComponent contractAddress={yourAddress} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
